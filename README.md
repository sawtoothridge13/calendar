## Tasks Breakdown

### Task 1: Calendar View

**Objective:** Implement a calendar view that displays sports events.

- Create a calendar interface for the current month.
- Display the days of the month in a grid format.
- Indicate days with scheduled sports events (e.g., with a marker or dot).
- Optionally, show brief event information (e.g., event name on the day cell).

### Task 2: Event Detail Page

**Objective:** Provide a way to view the full details of a specific event.

- When a user clicks on an event marker, navigate to a detail page.
- Display relevant event details, including:
  - Date and time
  - Sport type
  - Teams or participants
  - Additional details if available

### Task 3: Add Event Functionality

**Objective:** Allow users to add new events during runtime.

- Create a form for inputting event details:
  - Date
  - Time
  - Sport
  - Teams/participants
- Dynamically add the new event to the calendar view (runtime only, no persistence).

### Task 4: Responsiveness

**Objective:** Ensure full responsiveness on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

- Adapt layouts for smaller screens using responsive design techniques.
- Test usability and touch interactions on various devices and screen sizes.

### Task 5: Navigation

**Objective:** Create a navigation system for the application.

- Implement a navigation bar/menu to switch between:
  - Calendar view
  - "Add Event" page
- Ensure navigation is accessible from all pages.
