## Tasks Breakdown

### Task 1: Calendar View

**Objective:** Implement a calendar view that displays sports events.

- Create a calendar interface for the current month.
- Display the days of the month in a grid format.

- Optionally, show brief event information (e.g., event name on the day cell).

### Task 2: Event Detail Page

**Objective:** Provide a way to view the full details of a specific event.

- When a user clicks on an event marker, navigate to a detail page.
- Display relevant event details, including:
  - Date and time
  - Sport type

### Task 3: Add Event Functionality

**Objective:** Allow users to add new events during runtime.

- Create a form for inputting event details:

  - Time
  - Sport
  - Teams/participants
- Dynamically add the new event to the calendar view (runtime only, no persistence).
